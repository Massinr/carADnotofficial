        If driving verve isn't a top priority when shopping for a mid-size luxury SUV, the 2022 Volvo XC90, which serves up a whole lot of style and safety tech, is a solid choice. As the only three-row in Volvo's portfolio, it's best suited for shuttling families, even if its far-back seats aren't the most spacious. Still, it has one of the prettiest interiors in the class, which includes the BMW X5 and Porsche Cayenne. Both alternatives are better to drive, but they're considerably more expensive, too. Along with two four-cylinder options, the XC90 is also offered with a plug-in hybrid powertrain which has 455 horsepower, perkier acceleration, and 36 miles of electric-only range. No matter the powertrain, the 2022 XC90 is one of the most satisfying upper-class, three-row utes so we put it on our Editors' Choice list.
